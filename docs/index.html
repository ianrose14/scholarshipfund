                        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                        <p>The Dr. Allison Rose Memorial Fund was founded to advance neonatal nurse practitioner
                            (NNP) training in Atlanta. Atlanta-area neonatal ICUs are frequently understaffed in NNPs,
                            as is common throughout the country.
                            The Fund aims to address this problem by encouraging talented Atlanta-area RNs to
                            enroll in NNP programs and then return to help staff our NICUs upon graduation.</p>

                        <h3>Purpose</h3>
                        <p>The cost of Neonatal Nurse Practitioner programs can be a significant barrier to entry for
                            many qualified candidates. The Fund is specifically designed to help "bridge the gap" for
                            qualified candidates who otherwise would be financially unable to attend an NNP degree
                            program. Even if you have never previously considered pursuing an NNP degree, talk with
                            folks you work with - nurse managers, nurse educators, and existing NNPs - to see if this
                            might be a good fit for you.</p>

                        <h3>About Dr. Allison Rose</h3>
                        <p>The Fund was created to honor the legacy of Dr. Allison Thomas Rose. From medical school
                            onwards, Dr. Rose received all of her medical training at Emory, including appointments as
                            Pediatric Chief Resident from 2016-17 and Co-Chief Fellow (Division of Neonatology) from
                            2019-20. From 2020-25, she served as an attending in neonatology at all three Emory/CHOA
                            NICUs. Her clinical research focused on necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and the NEC Society
                            recognizes this work through the <a

                            Dr. Rose was a committed
                            advocate for infant and maternal health. Her work with the Georgia Chapter of the American
                            Academy of Pediatrics led to nearly $500,000/year being allocated to the 2022-23 Georgia
