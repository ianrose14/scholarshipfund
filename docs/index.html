                        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                        <p>The Dr. Allison Rose Memorial Fund was founded in 2025 to advance neonatal nurse practitioner
                            (NNP) training in Atlanta. Throughout much of the country, and certainly within the Emory
                            system, neonatal ICUs are significantly understaffed in NNPs. The Fund aims to address this
                            problem by focusing on the "top of the funnel": increasing the number of NNP students and
                            therefore the number of NNPs that will eventually be available on the job market.</p>

                        <h3>Purpose</h3>
                        <p>This scholarship fund is specifically designed to support registered nurses who are applying
                            to graduate school programs to become Neonatal Nurse Practitioners (NNPs). To this end, the
                            Fund's award decisions are need-aware, and the intent is that awards will be made to
                            qualified candidates that otherwise would be financially unable to attend an NNP degree
                            program.</p>

                        <h3>About Dr. Allison Rose</h3>
                        <p>The Fund was created to honor the legacy of Dr. Allison Thomas Rose. From medical school
                            onwards, Dr. Rose received all of her medical training at Emory, including appointments as
                            Pediatric Chief Resident from 2016-17 and Co-Chief Fellow (Division of Neonatology) from
                            2019-20. From 2020-25, she served as an attending in neonatology at all three Emory/CHOA
                            NICUs. Her clinical research focused on necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and the NEC Society
                            recognizes this work through the Allison Rose Advocacy Scholarship. Dr. Rose was a committed
                            advocate for infant and maternal health. Her work with the Georgia Chapter of the American
                            Academy of Pediatrics led to nearly $500,000/year being allocated to the 2022-23 Georgia
                            state fiscal budget for Medicaid coverage of donor human milk for inpatient use in premature
                            infants.</p>
